       <p> Hey, I'm glad you've stumbled upon me! I'm a Bachelor of Design and Computation Arts student at Concordia University, where I am constantly learning and growing my knowledge. My interests in the field of web design range from UX design to front-end web development, two of the most important areas of web design. I'm always excited to use my skills and learn new concepts and I'm actively looking for internships that will give me the chance to learn and grow.</p>
    <p>Whether it's creating a stunning website or developing an innovative app, I'm looking for a chance to apply my design and programming abilities in a way that has a meaningful and innovative impact on the world. I'm confident that these internships will give me the opportunity to work with great people and strengthen my skill set in the process. </p>
    <p>I have always been interested in web design and development. Strengthening my skills in React.js, HTML and CSS has enabled me to acquire industry-relevant abilities. My experience with object-oriented programming has encouraged me to create well-structured, neat code. Additionally, my proficiency in Figma and Adobe Suite has enabled me to create modern, attractive designs. Moreover, my aim as a student and intern is to continuously learn from others by working together, listening and putting knowledge into practice.</p>
